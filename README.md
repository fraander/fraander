### Hi there ðŸ˜„

I strive to **build products that revolutionize everyday moments** as I explore the intersection between **technology**, **business**, and **design**. I'm currently an undergraduate student at **Northeastern University**, majoring in **Computer Science** with a concentration in Human-centered Computing. 

My focuses include product management (Scrum Alliance CSPO and SAFe Agilist certified), web development, and iOS development. Feel free to reach out or connect if you find me or my work interesting ðŸ’™
