### Hi there 😄

I strive to **build products that revolutionize everyday moments** as I explore the intersection between **technology**, **business**, and **design**. I'm currently an undergraduate student at **Northeastern University** 🐾, majoring in **Computer Science** with a concentration in Human-centered Computing. 

My focuses include product management 📋 (Scrum Alliance CSPO and SAFe Agilist certified), web development 🌐, and iOS/macOS development 📱🖥️. Feel free to reach out or connect if you find me or my work interesting 💙
