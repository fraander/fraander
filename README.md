### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I strive to build products that revolutionize everyday moments as I explore the intersection between technology, business, and design. I'm currently an undergraduate student at Northeastern University, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Human-centered Computing and minoring in Information Ethics. 

My focuses include Product Management, Agile & Scrum, Web Development, and iOS Development. Feel free to reach out or connect if you find me or my work interesting ðŸ˜„
